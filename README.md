# Eye Detection and Blink Counter using YOLOv10

This project utilizes YOLOv10, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to detect eyes in real-time. The model is trained to differentiate between open and closed eyes and counts the number of blinks over a specified time period.

## Features

- **Real-time Eye Detection**: Detects eyes in a live video feed using the YOLOv10 model.
- **Open/Closed Eye Classification**: Determines whether the detected eyes are open or closed.
- **Blink Counter**: Counts the number of blinks within a session.
- **Customizable Blink Detection Settings**: Adjust sensitivity and detection thresholds.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- YOLOv10 model weights (pre-trained)
- Numpy
